We will open the doors at TELUS Digital in downtown Toronto to over 300 attendees for two full days of accessibility training. This two-day, one-track conference is a curated "playlist" of lectures, demos, and lightening talks.

Our mix of presentations and learning styles provides a unique and immersive learning experience.
