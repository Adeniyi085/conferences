On October 24th and 25th we will open the doors at TELUS Digital in downtown Toronto to over 300 attendees for two full days of accessibility training!

This two-day, one-track conference is a curated "playlist" of lectures, demos, and lightening talks.

Our mix of presentations and learning styles provides a unique and immersive learning experience which is true to the level of quality expected from the #a11yTO brand.
