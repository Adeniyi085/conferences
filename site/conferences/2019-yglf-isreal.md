Introducing a first-time for YGLF - YGLF Code Camp! This year, we decided to go with something a little different and spice things up. After three successful conferences in Israel, a superb one in Ukraine, and another one coming this spring in Lithuania, YGLF Code Camp is all about taking frontend tech out for a stroll in nature, offering a unique event, with overnight, to an exclusive group of experienced and enthusiastic frontend developers.
