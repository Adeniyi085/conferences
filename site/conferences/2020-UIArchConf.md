UIArchConf is a unique training event for those who work as UI Architects, or are looking to become a UI Architect. What's a UI Architect?

With the rise in sophistication of Web and Mobile front-end development, our industry has given rise to a new type of team player: UI Architect. We will explore the various aspects of UI Architecture, and the massive role a UI architect plays in an organization. From traditional "architect" tasks such as defining coding standards, to UX standardization, the UI Architect wears many hats, and is a leader within their company championing the user interface.
