The Web Professionals and Friends #barconf is a small but fine and almost free conference all about JavaScript, API's, Markup and Server-/Headless. It's the first conference in a series of six barcamps and three hackathons.

The conference is being held in german language. In case of international attendees most speakers will switch to english spoken talks.
