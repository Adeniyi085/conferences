The RuhrJS is an annual, community-driven JavaScript conference and the first of its kind in the metropolitan Ruhr Area in Germany. First held in 2016, the RuhrJS brings together an international line-up of renowned speakers with 200 JavaScript developers from all over the globe, creating a forum for developers to connect with companies and one another.  

We aim to foster a vibrant developer community and thereby strengthen our region's role in the tech industry. Our vision is to contribute to the digital transition of the Ruhr Area. We want to do our bit in making the region more attractive for everyone who is enthusiastic about JavaScript programming.  

We take particular pride in our diversity program. With the help of our sponsors, we can provide around 20% of our tickets to people from underrepresented groups every year.  

We are happy to welcome you in October, 5th and 6th in Bochum!
