In its third year after a successful debut in 2017, Decoupled Days is a conference for architects, developers, and businesspeople involved in implementing decoupled CMS architectures. The JavaScript and JAMstack track will cover modern JavaScript and its use in decoupled CMS architectures. Topics include universal JavaScript, server-side rendering, Node.js and ES2015 techniques, frameworks and libraries (e.g. Angular, Ember, React, Vue), static site generators (e.g. Gatsby), JAMstack architectures and hosting (e.g. Netlify), and JavaScript modernization efforts in Drupal.
