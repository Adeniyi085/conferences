The web is changing, fast! As a web developer, you need to evolve with it, or risk being left in the dust. fastr_conf aims to inform and empower web developers to be more productive, level-up their skills, and ultimately fast-track their projects and their careers. This is a one-day, single track, crash-course on disruptive technologies such as JAMstack and Static Site Generators that are making an impact in the industry.
