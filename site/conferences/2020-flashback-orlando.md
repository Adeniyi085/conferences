Flashback Conference looks at new and cutting-edge web development, browser APIs and developer tooling, but adds the understanding how theyâ€™ve evolved from early HTML, JavaScript and a dependency on plugins like Flash to the web of today. Flashback Conference will feature 2 days and approximately 15 speakers who are experts in the field of front-end development.
